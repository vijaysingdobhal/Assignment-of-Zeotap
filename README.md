# Customer Segmentation, Lookalike Model, and EDA

This repository contains the solutions to the **Customer Segmentation**, **Lookalike Model**, and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** tasks. The project demonstrates the application of data analysis, machine learning, and clustering techniques for customer data analysis.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights**
- Performed **EDA** on the provided customer dataset.
- Derived **business insights** based on the data to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and potential areas for business improvement.

### Task 2: **Lookalike Model**
- Built a **Lookalike Model** that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- The model calculates a **similarity score** for the top 3 lookalike customers for each user.
- Generated a **Lookalike.csv** with customer IDs and their corresponding similar customers and similarity scores.

### Task 3: **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
- Performed **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques on customer profile and transaction data.
- Used **K-Means clustering** to create customer segments.
- Evaluated the clustering performance using the **Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index)** and visualized the clusters using PCA.
- Outputted the segmentation results as a CSV file with customer IDs and their assigned cluster labels.
